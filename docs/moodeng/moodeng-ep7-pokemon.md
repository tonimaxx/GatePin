# The Moo Deng Multiverse Chronicles
## Episode 7: The First Hippo Trainer

### Chapter 1: A Wild Moo Deng Appears!

After boosting Charlie Brown's confidence, Moo Deng's medallion began flashing red and white. Dr. Narongwit appeared in an 8-bit style hologram.

"Agent Moo Deng, young trainers in the Pokémon world are struggling with goal-setting and persistence. Their frustration is causing reality barriers to weaken. With your experience in both viral fame and patient training..."

She materialized in Professor Oak's lab, next to three familiar Poké Balls.

### Chapter 2: Welcome to Pallet Town

"Fascinating!" Professor Oak adjusted his lab coat. "The first-ever Pokémon Trainer who is also a Pokémon!"

"I'm Ash!" A boy with a Pikachu rushed in. "And this is the coolest thing since we found out Slowpoke could use computers!"

"Pika pika!" agreed Pikachu, sniffing curiously at Moo Deng's medallion.
