# The Moo Deng Multiverse Chronicles
## Episode 4: The New Kid in Springfield

### Chapter 1: Yellow New World

After mastering the darkness in Gotham, Moo Deng's medallion glowed a bright yellow. Dr. Narongwit appeared, looking... strangely cartoonish.

"Agent Moo Deng, Springfield Elementary's reality barriers are weakening due to a surge in conformity and bullying. They need someone who can teach them about being uniquely themselves. And with your experience as a viral sensation..."

POOF! She materialized in front of a familiar yellow building.

### Chapter 2: Welcome to Springfield Elementary

"Ay caramba! A hippo!" Bart Simpson skated past as Principal Skinner stood at the entrance.

"Ah yes, our new exchange student," Skinner adjusted his tie. "Though I must say, our budget usually only covers hamsters."

Lisa Simpson approached with her saxophone. "Actually, according to my research, pygmy hippos are known for their unique personalities and adaptability to new environments!"

### Chapter 3: The Conformity Crisis

The problem became clear during assembly:
- Martin Prince hiding his intelligence
- Milhouse trying to be a bully to fit in
- Lisa considering giving up her jazz
- Ralph eating paste... (okay, that was normal)

Nelson's trademark "HAW HAW!" echoed through the halls, but Moo Deng noticed something: his laugh seemed forced, like he was playing a role he thought he had to play.

### Chapter 4: The B.A.R.T. System

### Chapter 8: Breaking the Machine

The children's combined uniqueness created such a surge of authentic energy that it overloaded Mr. Burns' Conformity Machine. The explosion showered Springfield with rainbow sparkles that made everyone's unique traits glow.
