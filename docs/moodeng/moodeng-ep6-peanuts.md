# The Moo Deng Multiverse Chronicles
## Episode 6: The Good Hippo

### Chapter 1: Good Grief!

Fresh from uniting Hogwarts houses, Moo Deng's medallion began to glow with a gentle, sketch-like warmth. Dr. Narongwit's hologram appeared in a distinctive zigzag pattern.

"Agent Moo Deng, we've detected anxiety-induced reality weakening in a unique universe. A boy named Charlie Brown needs help with self-confidence, and your experience with viral fame and overcoming challenges makes you perfect for this mission..."

She materialized next to a familiar brick wall, where someone had written "Happiness is a warm mud bath."

### Chapter 2: Welcome to the Neighborhood

"I got a rock," Charlie Brown sighed, kicking a pebble.

"I got a new friend!" Lucy announced, spotting Moo Deng. "Five cents for hippo advice!"

Snoopy descended from his doghouse, typing: "It was a dark and stormy night when the mysterious hippo arrived..."
