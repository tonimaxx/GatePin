# The Moo Deng Multiverse Chronicles
## Episode 8: Mathematical Emotions!

### Chapter 1: What Time Is It?

After mastering Pokémon training, Moo Deng's medallion started glowing in rainbow candy colors. Dr. Narongwit appeared as a dancing hologram.

"Agent Moo Deng, the Land of Ooo is experiencing emotional chaos! The Candy Kingdom's feelings are causing reality barriers to become totally mathematical... I mean, unstable. With your experience in bringing joy across universes..."

She materialized in a land made of candy, next to a tree fort.

### Chapter 2: Welcome to Ooo

"ALGEBRAIC! A bouncing hippo!" Finn jumped down from the tree fort.

"Mathematical analysis suggests she's from another dimension," Princess Bubblegum noted, while BMO danced around Moo Deng's feet.
