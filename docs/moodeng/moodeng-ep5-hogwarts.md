# The Moo Deng Multiverse Chronicles
## Episode 5: The Magical Exchange Student

### Chapter 1: The Letter Arrives

Just as Springfield's individuality was restored, Moo Deng's medallion began to sparkle with magical energy. Instead of Dr. Narongwit's hologram, an owl appeared with a letter:

*HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY*
*Headmistress: Minerva McGonagall*

*Dear Ms. Moo Deng,*

*We are pleased to inform you that the multiverse barriers near Hogwarts are weakening due to house rivalries and magical prejudices. Your unique ability to unite different groups is urgently needed...*

### Chapter 2: Platform 9¾

The medallion transported her directly onto Platform 9¾, where her appearance caused quite a stir:
- "Is that a magical creature?"
- "Must be a new professor!"
- "Did Hagrid get a new pet?"

Hermione Granger stepped forward, prefect badge gleaming. "Welcome to Hogwarts! I've read all about pygmy hippos in 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: Multiverse Edition.'"

### Chapter 3: The Sorting Ceremony

Professor McGonagall placed the Sorting Hat on Moo Deng's head:

*"Hmm... interesting... Jedi discipline of Gryffindor,*
*Avenger's teamwork pure Hufflepuff for sure,*
*Batman's mind shows Ravenclaw's way,*
*Springfield creativity makes Slytherin say...*
*Better be... ALL HOUSES!"*

The Great Hall erupted in confused chatter. Never had a student been sorted into all houses at once!

### Chapter 6: The Divide Curse

A mysterious curse began affecting the castle:
- House common rooms sealed themselves

- House colors became invisible to other houses
- Staircases refused inter-house movement

Peeves sang mockingly:
*"Division strong and unity weak,*
*Each house alone its path must seek,*
*When differences tear the school apart,*
*The barriers fall, reality's new start!"*

### Chapter 7: The Power of Unity
