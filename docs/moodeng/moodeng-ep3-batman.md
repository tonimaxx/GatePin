# The Moo Deng Multiverse Chronicles
## Episode 3: The Night Light Knight

### Chapter 1: A Dark Arrival

Fresh from grading superhero physics papers at Avengers Academy, Moo Deng's medallion began to pulse with an eerie black glow. Dr. Narongwit's hologram appeared, looking concerned.

"Agent Moo Deng, Gotham City needs you. The Riddler has created a fear-spreading puzzle that's making children afraid of the dark. With your Joy Wave powers and your experience with night security cameras at the zoo..."

The medallion transported her into the darkest city she'd ever seen.

### Chapter 2: Welcome to Gotham

"I AM VENGEANCE, I AM THE NIGHT, I AM... surprised to see a hippo."

Batman emerged from the shadows of the Batcave, where Moo Deng had materialized in a conveniently placed mud bath.

"I'm Moo Deng! I help kids across the multiverse, and I heard Gotham's children need help with fear."

"Hmm," Batman nodded. "The Riddler's latest scheme: The Dark Night Riddles. They make children terrified of darkness, weakening the multiverse barriers through their fear."

### Chapter 3: Riddle Me This

The Riddler's first message appeared on the Bat-computer:

*"What gets bigger the more you take away,
Makes brave kids shake and run away,
Turn on a light, it disappears,
Growing strongest with your fears?"*

"DARKNESS!" Moo Deng bounced excitedly. "At my zoo, we installed security cameras because some visitors were afraid, but we learned that understanding removes fear!"

Batman's eyes narrowed. "You might be onto something."
