## The Incredible Adventures of Stompy and Moodeng

Meet **Stompy**, the *vertically challenged* elephant with an `identity crisis`, and **Moodeng**, the *sassy* Pygmy hippo who believed he was actually a ***world-class comedian***! Their friendship was so ridiculous that even the ~~serious~~ wildlife documentarians couldn't help but laugh. Stompy would attempt to tell jokes using his trunk, which invariably ended with him `accidentally trumpeting` punchlines that sent nearby animals running, while Moodeng would roll on the ground in **hysterical laughter**, occasionally letting out a *hippo-sized guffaw* that could be heard miles away. Their daily adventures included **epic fails** at hide-and-seek (because let's face it, a *massive elephant* and a *tiny hippo* are not exactly stealth champions), ***interpretive dance competitions*** that looked more like a natural disaster than art, and impromptu comedy routines that left the savanna wondering if they had accidentally stepped into a comedic parallel universe. ~~Serious~~ *Wildlife experts* would later describe their relationship as "a walking, trumpeting, laughing disaster waiting to happen" - but Stompy and Moodeng? They just called it **Tuesday**. üêòü¶õ
