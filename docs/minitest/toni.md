## Toni: Markdown Superhero Extraordinaire

Meet **Toni Maxx**, the *absolutely ridiculous* superhero who ~~accidentally~~ **intentionally** traversed between the Marvel and DC universes, causing utter chaos and hilarity! With a `multiversal teleporter` strapped to his belt and a **bold** sense of humor, Toni would randomly pop up in the middle of epic battles, shouting ***"WHO NEEDS SAVING TODAY?"*** He once interrupted a serious confrontation between Batman and the Joker by *accidentally* teleporting the Hulk right into the Batmobile, creating a scene so absurd that even ~~Superman~~ *Captain America* couldn't help but laugh. His costume? A mishmash of **DC** and **Marvel** logos, with patches that read `"Interdimensional Party Crasher"` and a cape that changed colors faster than he changed universes. Poor ~~Iron Man~~ *Green Lantern* never knew whether to treat him as a friend or a **certified menace**. Toni's ultimate superpower? Making ***EPIC*** crossover moments that would make comic book fans both cringe and cheer simultaneously! ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüåå
